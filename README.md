### How to use

Not sure yet.  Maybe cd into your day folder and `go run`, or maybe better to try `go test`

### Dev environment

Open in VSCode, enable (Remote - Containers)[https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers], and re-open the project in the dev container.  Then you'll have golang installed/isolated.
